<p>
Craftsvilla.com is a marketplace to "Discover Unique Indian Products" including Handmade, Vintage,
 Ethnic, Organic and Natural products from India.India is a beautiful assortment of diversity reflected in our Clothing, 
 Food, Lifestyle, Language, Music, Books etc. This diversity is so rich and diverse that an attempt to capture it on a single 
 platform was never made. Craftsvilla.com is that sincere attempt by bunch of young insane guys and gals who 
 think this is possible now with the Internet.</p>

<p>Craftsvilla.com uses a marketplace model to capture the regional variations of India.
We connect local artisans & designers directly to global customers and thereby increase 
their livelihood, remove middlemen, help them create/promote their brand and thereby preserve our culture, 
traditions and values. We believe this journey will not only help artisans of India but also help customers 
discover and buy products which they otherwise are not able to do today.</p>
